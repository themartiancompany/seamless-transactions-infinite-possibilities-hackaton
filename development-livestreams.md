# Hackaton development livestreams

In this document I'm gathering the Life and DogeOS
public development video livestreams strictly related to the hackaton
work. A meaningful amount DogeOS and Life development livestream
spent still working on the same hackaton projects have
been made available since mid-2024.

I'd like to make the readers aware in case the videos
were to disappear for any reason independent from my will
before the hackaton's end, that the streams' text recordings are all
made redundantly available, undeletable and uncensorable on the
[EVMFS](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
and reposted on my uncensorable Twitter account, which can
be currently browsed with the aid of a third-party centralized
[blockchain network explorer](

read directly from the blockchains on which the Twitter
contract has been deployed or with the decentralized
Twitter application.
