# "Seamless transactions, infinite possibilities" Hackaton project

The repository you're browsing contains details about the software
project I am presenting to the
["seamless transactions, infinite possibilities"](
  https://hackathon.stackup.dev/web/events/seamless-transactions-infinite-possibilities)
hackaton, set up by
[Stack Up](
  https://stackup.dev)
and sponsored by
[Google](
  https://google.com)
and
[PayPal](
  https://paypal.com).

### The project

I'm still not sure actually what I am gonna present for this competition,
as the choice will mostly be determined by what I'll manage to finish
to write in time by the 7th of April 2025.

The requirements are for a product which supports and integrates the
[PyUSD](
  https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto/pyusd)
PayPal USD stablecoin and which provides network connectivity
using the
[Google Blockchain RPC service](
  https://cloud.google.com/blockchain-rpc/docs/quickstart).

So that's kinda of a broad theme you know.

In any case it will probably be one of these two, or if I manage, both:

- adding support for purchasing applications on the
  [uncensorable Ur Life and DogeOS user repository and application store](
    https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
  using the PayPal USD stable-coin token on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
  compatible blockchain networks supported by Google RPC service,

- writing a full fledged uncensorable stand-alone web application for the
  [Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
    https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
  (EVMFS) which will allow users to cover the networks' gas fees for the uploads
  using the PayPal USD stable-coin token on networks supported by the Google
  RPC service.

I suppose I should specify I am the author of both the Ur and the EVMFS.

Completing either of those tasks will require quite some work on a decent
amount of software projects, all of which I am gonna include, except than
if being told otherwise, as git submodules to this repository.

The Hackaton terms require me to provide the jury, except than with you know,
the code, or I suppose at least part of it, a presentation video for the project.

If I am correct I have available until the 7th of April to present
everything. So, to speed up things and make myself more comfortable
with managing the tasks,
I am including the following placeholder video which will be replaced
with the real one before that date:

### Licenses

All the projects I do write are usually released under the terms of the
GNU Affero General Public License version 3, but I'm not actually sure
that license is allowed by the hackaton terms, so we'll see if I will
have to release some work using a non-copyleft, less strict license,
in particular because if I remember correctly, Google does not like
much that license.

I have sent an e-mail to the Stack Up team and I'm currently awaiting for
an answer.
