# "Seamless transactions, infinite possibilities" Hackaton project

The repository you're browsing contains details about the software
project I am presenting to the
["seamless transactions, infinite possibilities"](
  https://hackathon.stackup.dev/web/events/seamless-transactions-infinite-possibilities)
hackaton, set up by
[Stack Up](
  https://stackup.dev)
and sponsored by
[Google](
  https://google.com)
and
[PayPal](
  https://paypal.com).

### The project

The hackaton requirements are for a product which supports and integrates the
[PyUSD](
  https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto/pyusd)
PayPal USD stablecoin and which provides network connectivity
using the
[Google Blockchain RPC service](
  https://cloud.google.com/blockchain-rpc/docs/quickstart).

The task project time has chosen for me strictly related to
the hackaton is adding support for purchasing applications on the
[uncensorable Ur Life and DogeOS user repository and application store](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
using the PayPal USD stable-coin token on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
compatible blockchain networks supported by Google RPC service.

I suppose I should specify I am the author of both the Ur and the EVMFS.

Completing either of those tasks will require quite some work on a decent
amount of software projects, all of which I am gonna include, except than
if being told otherwise, as git submodules to this repository.

Notes for the first task are being gathered in the
[Ur PYUSD support](
  ur-pyusd-support.md)
page.

I'd like to remind the jury that it's almost an year now that I livestream
the Life and DogeOS development work on my
[X profile](
  https://x.com/truocolo),
so it's not a big effort to link those related to the hackaton on a dedicated
[page](
  development-livestreams.md)
of this repository.

The Hackaton terms require me to provide the jury, except than with you know,
the code, or I suppose at least part of it, a presentation video for the project.

### Licenses

All the projects I do write are usually released under the terms of the
GNU Affero General Public License version 3, but I'm not actually sure
that license is allowed by the hackaton terms, so we'll see if I will
have to release some work using a non-copyleft, less strict license,
in particular because if I remember correctly, Google does not like
much that license.

I have sent an e-mail to the Stack Up team and I'm currently awaiting for
an answer.
