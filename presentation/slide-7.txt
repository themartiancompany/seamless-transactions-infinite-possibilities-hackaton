  What's the Ur?                                                 |
                                                                 |

     The Ur derives its uncensorability from hosting             |
     its applications' database on permissionless                |
     Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible networks.               |
                                                                 |
     Developers can choose if to have applications' sources      |
     and binary resources undeletable as well,                   |
     thus publishing entirely uncensorable and undeletable       |
     computer applications.                                      |
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
